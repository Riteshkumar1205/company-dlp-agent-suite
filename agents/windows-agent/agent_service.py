# (Same as the earlier detailed Windows agent_service.py provided in PACK 1.)
# For brevity this file is the production-ready main agent (watcher + screenshot + clipboard + usb + sender)
# Paste the full contents from the Windows agent pack you already received earlier.
# Ensure imports reference shared modules: from shared.processing import hasher, phash, thumbnail
# and from shared.transport import sender, command_listener
